They were neighbors staying next to each other
Soma always used to delay his work
Deena went to the forest and looked out for woods
So Deena walked towards the river
There, he found a big tree
Soon God answered his prayer
God appeared and asked him, why he was crying
He told about the incident
It glittered as it was made of gold
But Deena said no without any hesitation
The God again took another axe from the river
It was made of silver
” God now pulled an axe made of iron
Deena’s face showed the sign of joy
He said yes and was overjoyed
Deena happily went to his home with the three axes
Soma was curious to know what has happened
So, without the knowledge of Deena, Soma followed him
Deena reached the house and called his wife
She came there and saw the axes
She was surprised
Soma followed Deena to the forest
Deena went near the river and started his work
He waited till Deena left
God took out his iron axe first
He said no intentionally
He again denied
God took out the golden axe
He quickly said yes
All his shouting went useless
