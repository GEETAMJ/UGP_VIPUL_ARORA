Long ago, there lived a woodcutter in a small village
He was sincere in his work and very honest
Every day, he set out into the nearby forest to cut trees
He brought the woods back into the village and sold them out to a merchant and earn his money
He earned just about enough to make a living, but he was satisfied with his simple living
The river was so deep, he could not even think to retrieve it on his own
He became a very worried thinking how he will be able to earn his living now!  He was very sad and prayed to the God
I can’t cut the trees with a golden axe
It’s not useful for me”
